          The payments are calculated according to the configuration in app/config/days_hours_configuration.rb

            Each line of the file is expected in the format:

              <ID>=<DAY><HOUR1>-<HOUR2>[,<DAY><HOUR1>-<HOUR2>]...

            where:

              <ID> : identifies the worker, ex: RENE

              <DAY>: upcased first 2 letters of the day: MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU 

              <HOUR1>: hour in the range 00:00 to 23:59, in format h:m with 0 <= h <= 23 and  0 <= m <= 59
            
              <HOUR2>: hour(see <HOUR1> for more) greater than or equals to <HOUR1>
